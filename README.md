# neural-network
A neural network that is optimized using the particle swarm optimization method. 

Run index.html, open the developer console of the browser and write 
- evaluate(globalBestNetwork) - this will give you the error of the current best solution
- sendSignalsThroughNetwork(globalBestNetwork, data[0]) - this will run the first data point through the network and give you the result. it should be 0
- sendSignalsThroughNetwork(globalBestNetwork, data[1]) - this will run the second data point through the network and give you the result. it should be 0.1
- and so on
